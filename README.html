<h1 id="encrypt">Encrypt!</h1>

<p>Hey! I wrote a project for encrypting a text into bitmap file that human eye cannot recognize that. this program using a cool algorithm that showed below. </p>



<h2 id="title"><img src="https://github.com/gsoosk/Encrypt-Bitmap/raw/master/1.png" alt="over view" title=""></h2>



<h2 id="note">Note:</h2>

<p>it was one of my first project in c++ and I didn’t use classes and object oriented at all! </p>

<p>it has not make file eighter and it just including one file.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>

<p><strong>encrypting :</strong>  <br>
1. read bitmap <br>
2. seperate picture into 8*8 squares and calculate variance of any RGB colors <br>
3. get message from user <br>
4. get key from user and make a random string using that key belong seed  <br>
5. for every square :</p>

<ol>
<li>choose one square using random seed</li>
<li>change LSB of pixel that choosed</li>
<li>repeat 5 until message ends</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://github.com/gsoosk/Encrypt-Bitmap/raw/master/2.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""> <br>
and save bitmap</p>

<p><strong>decrypting :</strong> <br>
1. read bitmap <br>
2. seperate picture into 8*8 squares and calculate variance of any RGB colors <br>
3. get key from user and make a random string using that key belong seed  <br>
4. . for every square :</p>

<ol>
<li>choose one square using random seed</li>
<li>read LSB and adding to string </li>
<li>repeat 4 until seeing \n</li>
</ol>

<p>and save message into disk.</p>

<h4 id="input-and-output"><i class="icon-pencil"></i> Input and Output</h4>

<p>first line encrypt <br>
second line bitmap file name <br>
third line is your key <br>
forth line Is your message</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>encrypt <br>
  image.bmp <br>
  2132 <br>
  I like pizza !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>first line decrypt for decrypting <br>
second line bitmap file name <br>
third line is your key</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decrypt <br>
  coded-image.bmp <br>
  21211</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Note :</em></strong> bitmap should be in program repository.</p>
